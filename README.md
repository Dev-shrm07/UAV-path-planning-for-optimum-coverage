#DDPG-Based UAV Trajectory Planning for Optimal Coverage of UE Devices
This project aims to utilize the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for planning the trajectory of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in order to achieve optimal coverage of User Equipment (UE) devices.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
Tensorflow 2.x
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

#Algorithm Description
DDPG is an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that is well-suited for continuous action spaces. The UAV's trajectory is represented as a sequence of continuous actions, making DDPG a natural choice for this problem. The actor network is used to determine the UAV's next action, while the critic network is used to evaluate the quality of the action.

The UE devices are modeled as a set of points in a 2D space, and the UAV's coverage of the devices is measured using a coverage metric. The UAV's trajectory is optimized by maximizing the coverage metric over a set of predefined waypoints.
